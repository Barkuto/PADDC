# PADDC
A Damage Calculator for the game Puzzle and Dragons

Basically a glorified spreadsheet at this point.

Coming Soon™:
- Monster database to choose from.
- Tabs to have both a Team A and Team B, possibly also a team C
- Custom combo menu, not an ugly table
- NA Android/iOS app MegaSoon™

You are free to use any code from this project, but correct and clearly stated credit for my code must be made.


# Installation
Download latest release, and double click the .jar file, or run the command `java -jar PADDC-<version>.jar` in a terminal.

If you are on a Linux installation, you will need to install JavaFX, because it does not come bundled with the Linux Java package. Just run the command `apt-get install openjfx`.
